                        <p class="histparagraph">Constructed in 1914 and situated on Rissik Street, smack bang in the middle of Joburg CBD is the Johannesburg City Hall. This is one of the oldest buildings in the city and it has seen many historical events take place on its steps, from a range of protest marches and political rallies to a bomb blast in the late 80s. It’s rather strange to think that this building has been around since the days of ox-wagons! If you find yourself in downtown Jozi, be sure to admire its Edwardian architecture and solid sandstone walls.</p>

                            <p class="histparagraph">In tribute to and memory of Hector Pieterson and those who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom during the 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto, this museum is a symbol of the youth's resistance to Apartheid. The museum houses disturbing evidence in the form of verbal testimonials, pictures, audiovisual displays as well as documents that are related to the events of that day. The sights and sounds and atmosphere will, in fact, have you feeling as though you are right in the middle of the uprising and bloody aftermath.</p>
